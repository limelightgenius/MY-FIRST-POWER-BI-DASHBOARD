# MY-FIRST-POWER-BI-DASHBOARD

E-Commerce Sales Analysis 
What I Built
Hey! This is my very first Power BI dashboard. I created it to practice what I learned in my first week of studying Power BI (In My data analytics journey). It shows sales data from an online store in a way that's easy to understand at a glance.
Questions I Tried to Answer
When I started this project, I imagined I was helping a shop owner understand their business better. Here are the questions I wanted to answer:

How much money did we make overall? - Answer: 255.54 in total sales

How many people bought stuff? - Answer: 86,667 orders - that's a lot of customers!

What's the average amount each customer spends? - Answer: 118.83M per order


Which products sell the most?
Grocery items are #1 (28M in sales)
Electronics come in second (25M)
Home Decor, Books, and Clothing all do pretty well too (around 22M each)


When do we sell the most throughout the year?
February was our best month (13M!)
July was also really good (11.7M)
January was super slow (only 0.1M) - maybe people spent all their money during Christmas?


Which countries are our customers from?
I added filters so you can check sales by country: Australia, Canada, Germany, UK, and USA



What I Used to Build This
Power BI Stuff I Learned

- Power Query: This is where I cleaned up the messy data before making visuals
Charts & Graphs:

Bar chart to compare product categories
Line chart to show sales over time
Big number cards for important metrics (because they look cool!)


- Filters: Added buttons to filter by country
Colors: I picked different colors to make each section stand out

Why I Chose These Colors

Blue for total orders (seemed trustworthy)
Green for average order value (money = green!)
Pink for total sales (wanted it to pop!)
Orange/peach for the monthly trend (warm and friendly)

Cool Stuff I Noticed
Grocery and Electronics are popular! These two categories make the most money
February and July are busy months - maybe we should run special promotions during these times
January is slow - probably because everyone just finished holiday shopping
People spend a lot per order - the average is pretty high!

What I Actually Did (Step-by-Step)
Getting the Data Ready

Opened Power BI and imported my CSV file with sales data
Clicked around in Power Query to clean things up:

Deleted rows with missing information
Made sure dates looked like dates and numbers looked like numbers
Fixed any weird spacing or typos


BUILDING THE DASHBOARD!
Created my metrics: Used DAX (it's like Excel formulas but for Power BI) to calculate totals and averages
Added visuals one by one:

Started with the big KPI cards at the top because they're the most important
Added the bar chart to compare categories
Put in a line chart to show the monthly trend


Made it interactive: Added country filters so people can explore by region
Picked colors: Tried different color schemes until I found one that looked good
Tested everything: Clicked all the filters to make sure they worked!

Problems I Ran Into (and Fixed!)

Problem: My numbers were way too long and hard to read
Fix: Changed the format to show "M" for millions and "K" for thousands


Problem: I wanted to include everything but my dashboard looked too crowded
Fix: Focused on just 5 main things and used filters for the rest



My Reflection
Why do KPI dashboards impress business leaders?
Honestly, before this project, I didn't get why dashboards were such a big deal. But now I understand! Imagine being a busy shop owner - you don't have time to look through hundreds of rows in Excel. A dashboard lets you see EVERYTHING important in like 10 seconds:

Is business going well?  (Check the big numbers)
What should I stock up on?  (Look at the bar chart)
When should I hire extra staff? (Check the busy months)

It's like having a really smart assistant that organized all your business info in one place. No wonder bosses love these!


What I Learned
✅ How to import and clean data in Power BI
✅ How to make different types of charts
✅ How to use filters and make dashboards interactive
✅ How to pick colors and layouts that make sense
✅ How to think like a business owner (what questions matter most?)
Where I Am in My Learning
I started learning Power BI just 5 days ago, and I'm pretty proud of what I built! It's not perfect, but it actually works and tells a story.
Next steps: I'm going to learn DAX better and add more advanced features like custom tooltips!
